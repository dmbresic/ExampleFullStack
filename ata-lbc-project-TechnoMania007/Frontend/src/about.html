        <h3>About Flight.Me</h3>

        <p>Flight.Me was founded in 2022, with one goal in mind, never having to sit in a cramped airplane again. A group of four rag tag<br>
        entry level software engineers put together a plan to take on the industry of the sky. They put together a cost effective and essential<br>
        online charter flight service. Our goal, get you there.</p>

        <h2>Ryan Umphrey</h2>
        <p>Local wizard with words. Holds a degree as an English major, turned Software Dev. Excellent hair and always has a smile. He is the mind<br>
        that puts our propaganda together to make you buy our services.</p>

        <h2>Santiago Aristi</h2>
        <p>Boy genius with test writing and implementing site functionality. He's basically a backend wizard with what he can do with test writing.<br>
        He's a machine and he kills pretty much everything that he is able to put his hands on.</p>

        <h2>Jason Adams</h2>
        <p>A master of method calls. Secretly enjoys front-end web development. He was basically the reason anything posts to the site in the first place. His work with logistics<br>
        gives us the leading edge in knowing how to cut costs and still be safe while we fly you to your destination.</p>

        <h2>David Bresich</h2>
        <p>A pretty regular guy, writes some code. He made most of this webpage and got frustrated with aligning images and just kind of gave up.
            <br>I don't really know what to write in here, I'm just hoping that I can get the JavaScript done for this project. This whole thing <br>
            scares me and I don't really know if I can do it correctly. But, here's to nothing and good times! Huzzah!
